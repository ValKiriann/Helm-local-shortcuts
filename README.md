# Helm-local-shortcuts
A collection of bash scripts that I found useful when developing Helm charts and testing locally.  

Repetitive tasks that I use in my day to day coding are now compiled into a light command to reduce time I spend testing the rendering outputs in my helm charts.

## Install

Just grab the .sh file of the script you want to use and either drop it in your binaries folder or leave it in a dir of your choice. Remember to add the executable permission with chmod + x and call it with the positional parameters needed.
